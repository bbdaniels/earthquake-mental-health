the current household consumption measure,
respondent age, gender, marital status and education level,
as well as geographical controls for
distance to epicenter and the slope of the region.
The second includes an interaction term for
consumption and proximity to the activated fault.
The third includes fixed effects at the village level;
the fourth and fifth include fixed effects at the village level
and separately report estimates for women and men.
All regressions are clustered by village (N=126).
